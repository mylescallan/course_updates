**The Issue:**

**Category**: ntent needs more detail

**Follow-on**: What topic needs more detail?

**Commentary**: I don't know why I have to multiple by the probability of having
cancer. Why can't I just multiple together the probability of
P(Pos|C) * P(Pos|-C)? What additional detail should be included?
