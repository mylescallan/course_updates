## Issue
**Issue number** _(& page link)_: 541 [`index`==541 and `Course Name`=='Practical Statistics' and `Lesson Name`=='Logistic Regression' and `Page Name`=='Quiz: Fitting Logistic Regression in Python'](https://mocha.udacity.com/programs/nd496-mentors-sandbox/en-us/construction/courses/545f4c46-ae54-4164-897e-4a0bb573302d/lessons/ls12054/pages/2bae5c2b-48b0-4439-b459-f3bc5cae9dd1)

**The Issue:**

**Category**: Error in quiz, solution, and/or feedback

**Follow-on**: What error did you encounter?

**Commentary**: Even though the code for the logistic regression is right, there
is an error message saying "module 'scipy.stats' has no
attribute 'chisqprob'". Actions such as updates based on
feedback of Udacity GPT have not been successful. Why is this an
error? Because it is not possible to get a solution for the quiz
exercises which is very frustrating even though the code is
right.

**Comments**: This is really dissatisfying and discouraging for the learning
progress. You should do better Udacity!!!
